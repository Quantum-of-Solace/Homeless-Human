# Payee Services
This program serves chronically homeless individuals and families. This instability is mostly a result of mismanagement of their funds (which may be due to mental or physical disabilities). Protective payee services ensure that rent and utility costs are paid, along with other personal expenses, thus securing stability for the most vulnerable in our community.

### Eligibility Criteria for Protective Payee Service
*   Assists households receiving Social Security(SSI/SSA) and DSHS benefits.
*   Associated Ministries staff manages finances and provides financial counseling.
*   Households receiving DSHS benefits must receive referral from DSHS case workers.
*   SSI/SSA households must call for an appointment.

### **Payee Office Hours**

## Coordinated Entry - Rapid Re-Housing

* * *

As part of the strategic plan to end homelessness in Pierce County and to design a “best practice” model to serve homeless households, Associated Ministries, in partnership with Catholic Community Services, Greater Lakes Mental Health Care and Comprehensive Life Resources, has contracted with Pierce County to provide coordinated entry for homeless households.

As part of Coordinated Entry, a Coordinated Entry Specialist will work one-on-one with individuals to enable stability. Services will include, but are not limited to, referrals to housing programs or independent housing and assistance/referrals in securing benefits. For rental assistance please call 211.

### Do I Qualify?

* * *

We accept individuals and families who are referred by Coordinated Entry. We also assist with some move in costs and very short term rental assistance. Using the Housing First model we address homelessness and then provide resources to address any needs clients have. The idea of mandating services in order to have the basic human right of housing has proven to be ineffective. It causes individuals and families more harm than good.

In our program, we meet the clients where they are in life. This program is all about what the clients want and need. They are in charge of their destinies and know their situation better than we do. Families receive referrals to employment services, mental health services, and resources to gain tools for self-sufficiency. Empowering clients to take control of their lives is the key to our Family Permanent Housing Program.

#### Office Hours for Coordinated Entry

*   Mon.-Fri. 9am-5pm (some evening appointments available), closed for lunch 12-1pm.

#### Coordinated Entry Contact Information

*   (253) 682-3401 Phones lines are open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday 11am-3pm.
