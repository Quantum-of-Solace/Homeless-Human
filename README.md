##Center for Direct Services


Associated Ministries’ Center for Direct Services works with families and individuals throughout Pierce County to build stronger community by building stronger households. Many of our direct services focus upon housing, as the foundation for dignity, stability and growth. These services include providing Centralized Intake for Homelessness Intervention through Access Point for Housing (AP4H); assisting families and individuals with re-housing; working with faith communities to reduce barriers to housing and to create new affordable housing; and youth homelessness prevention.


The Center for Direct Services strives to work with households from a strength-based approach, identifying the strengths and supports that a household already possesses, and connecting to community and more formal resources to help build toward self-sufficiency. In connecting to community, we seek to engage volunteers in ways that are meaningful for the households and volunteers.
