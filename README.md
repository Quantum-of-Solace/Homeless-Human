**Help lift hard-working families out of poverty!  **

## Volunteer Income Tax Assistance

From late January through April 15th, VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance) helps low and moderate-income households through free tax preparation.


Each year, nearly 5,000 households in Pierce County are helped by free tax sites. This service brings millions of dollars back into our community through tax credits and refunds, and helps hard-working families pay bills and save for the future.


**How can you help?**


Volunteers may serve as: 1) Tax Preparers, who complete tax returns; 2) Quality Reviewers, who check returns for accuracy; 3) Site Coordinators, who oversee tax sites; 4) Greeters, who welcome clients; and 5) Interpreters, who translate for non-English speaking or hearing-impaired customers.


No experience required, and free training is provided. VITA offers flexible hours (days, evenings and weekends) and locations throughout Pierce County. All VITA sites are IRS-approved.
