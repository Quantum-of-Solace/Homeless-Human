# Common Questions about AP4H Services

### Does Access Point 4 Housing include ALL shelters and housing in Pierce County?  
* AP4H includes shelters and housing programs that are funded by Pierce County. We are having conversations with programs that do not receive this funding with the goal of developing partnerships that will benefit families experiencing homelessness._Types of programs included in AP4H are:_  
  * Emergency Shelters  
  * Transitional Housing Programs  
  * Diversion & Navigation Programs  
  * Permanent Supportive Housing Programs  
  * Rapid Re-housing

### Will Access Point 4 Housing get my family into housing faster/same day?  
  * It is important that we are clear so your family has realistic expectations. AP4H is not creating additional housing resources and this process will not get your family into shelter or housing more quickly. This new process will make it easier for your family to navigate the housing system in Pierce County; instead of calling 80+ programs individually, you will now have a single access point to current shelter and housing resources.

### Are Section 8 vouchers included?  
  * Section 8 wait lists remain the same as they have been.

### Can AP4H help pay my rent or utilities?  
  * We do not provide rental or utility assistance.
